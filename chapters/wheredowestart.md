#Where do we start?

## We start with why.
You will notice that there are three parts to this guide.
Where do we start?
Where do we go?
How do we get there?
These are my necessary three questions to starting and completing a project yet they are not as important as this. We start with why. 

Why do you want to make a game? 
Do you want millions of users to play it?
Do you want to make it for yourself?
Do you want millions of dollars because you read about someone else achieving that?

Why is it that you want to make a game? If you don’t know why, this guide won’t suit you.  I know that’s a very bold statement, because even if you don’t know why you are doing this, you will learn a lot from this guide, but that’s the reason this question is so important.

When you define this, you are defining your goal or better yet your passion. I am firm believer that when you know WHY you are doing something you will never think of failing (something we discuss more about in part 2). The thought won’t ever cross your mind because when you have a “WHY” motive backing you, the rest is moot. Defining a WHY means creating the most solid structure not even a nuclear bomb could destroy. 

So before we dive into where we start, write down why you are doing this. Here is why I am writing this guide. 

Beginning game developers can get started (there are many guides and tutorials on this) but very few can finish, rinse and repeat.
Even professional game developers can get lost in what makes a game (no matter the scale) memorable. It is important to know in advance, what you can implement that is proven to give your game the best chance at being entertaining.

I feel that these two points are extremely overlooked and underutilized. That is why this guide exists and it is my hope that you can benefit from it.

## Stop Calling it a Hobby
It’s a lot easier than you think. To do this you need to take that passion (the one that brought you here) and focus it solely on your end product. Too much dreaming about what could be in your game gets in the way of actually finishing your game. By steering your passion to focus on the end result, you will see yourself change from hobbyist to professional quickly. I call this, the professional mindset.
Define the Scope
Once you’ve applied the professional mindset (I.E You know what your finish line looks like) it’s time to ask, how do I start? This is where we define the scope of our game and list our core functions that our game couldn’t exist without. We will go into further detail about core functionality in Part 3 but for now, let’s focus on two at a time. When you start to define, even with only two, the rest of the scope follows. For example, if you’re making a “Metroidvania” type game, then your first core function is your player movement and making sure you handle all directions. Your second core function is the camera as those two functions are synonymous to any Metroidvania game.
Once those essentials are complete, we look at what our next two essentials are. Most likely, we need to design our level and add some enemies! After we add those in, we take a look at our next two. Just like that we’ve mapped out our game.
Struggling to start or finish your project can be your toughest enemy yet. Essential core function breakdown is what defines the scope of your game and is all you need to start sharing it publicly.

## Now… Share
This is your time to shine and really, it’s your time to share. What do you do in an age where everyone can access your content just by opening their phones? 

Record a .gif (I recommend GifCam) publish it on Twitter with relevant hashtags like #gamedev #name_of_software #style_of_art
Post screenshots/updates/.gifs on forums (Listed later below)
Post Devlogs on YouTube 

The longer you wait to share, the more likely your game won’t ever get finished. This is where you run into trouble. You are ready to become a professional, you know what the finish line looks and you’ve defined your scope but what if you can’t do it all? 

For whatever reason there has been this romantic idea floating around for awhile that you can produce the next viral game and become a multi-millionaire overnight, all by yourself. 
While this may work in rare instances, don’t go at this alone. If you are making a game that you want people to play, ask for help! Help can come in different ways, and that’s why you need to share as of reading this. Just by getting a retweet on your .gif or a comment on your screenshot will get you in communication with someone that could be crucial to your success!

For me, I’ve never been able to make quality artwork. So instead of wasting my time throwing a poorly drawn character together, I hire artists! Usually, the same one over and over but every now and then I experiment. Never use a freelancer as an excuse to slow you down. Whether you bring on an artist or sound tech or narrative designer, they should never work more hours on your project then you. The more quality effort you show to your project, the more they will respond with their work. 

To finish the work you start, never divert from this way of developing. Once you get your first core function done you can move forward and this method will never allow you to sacrifice quality - instead forces you to face the task head-on and make it the best you can while you go.

## Clone Your Favorites
If you are just starting out (or if you are out of ideas) it’s always a great learning experience to clone your favorite game(s). I’ve applied this to both 2D and 3D and it has done wonders for me. By cloning a game you already know what to expect. Think about it, you already have the idea (and with some luck, the art), and better yet, you have the entire gameplay to match! You don’t have to think of anything new or different, it’s all right there for you!

I hope you realize how powerful this is. When you are starting out, your primary goal should be to get to a point where you can make your own original game. But almost all original ideas have been influenced from something else one way or another. By cloning your favorite game you are now more in-tune with the finer details and this will definitely help you down the road. You want to get everything as close to the original as possible and I guarantee you will notice a few things you missed. For example, those “post-production” sounds. You know, the extra impacts, swishes and hits. Sometimes even, there are more than 10 sounds randomly playing for 1 action!

It’s most likely that the game you’ve always wanted to make emulates from a game you have played. Maybe you want to make a space shooter, why not make a Galaga clone? Or a Platformer? Metal Slug is always a great place to start. Whatever it is, when you program a clone, you are giving yourself the best behind the scenes look.

This entire book revolves around setting you up for success to finish your game, rinse then repeat so don’t get too stuck on the whole idea of “cloning”. However, do pay closer attention to every single game you play that is relevant to your idea.

For me, when I was making my Action Platformer engine (and some of my first tutorials) I wanted to emulate the weapons from the indie game, Super Crate Box. It was by far the most rewarding “clone” I have ever made and I never finished the engine. Cloning doesn’t have to be about making a finished clone instead it can be about replicating features you want in your game!

The entire time I worked on my Super Crate Box clone, I only wanted to focus on the weapons. Coming up with my own systems to store the guns, fire the bullets whether they were manual or automatic, and then coupling them with the effects put a huge smile on my face! Not to mention, the original source for Super Crate Box was release in a Humble Bundle, so I was able to grab the exact same artwork and sounds. 

*Be very careful here. Just because you can access the same art and sounds does NOT mean they are yours!

Cloning a game and or its features is a great way to start your career in Game Design. You may not be able to make a living off of it but it speed up your design knowledge and give you a behind the scenes look at what a complete game feels like. Not to mention, it can help get your name out there which is almost just as good as getting a sale!


## Gain An Audience

By making a clone your work won’t go unnoticed. In fact, the more popular the game, the more likely your clone will get played. In this case, you should not only open source your clone but also make videos of you programming it!

In doing so you will have tapped into that game's audience, and convert them to your own. They will automatically admire the work you put into what is presumably one of their favorites and start to follow your career!

To gain traction online, we’ve established that cloning is a favorable starting point but how do we take control from there? Building your reputation is all about delivering consistent free value. Most professional game developers don’t have a lot of free time to go off and make clones, open source it, release devlogs, and upload videos about what they just made, so instead they use the other option and post .gifs on Twitter (or Tumblr). Gifs are compelling because of how simple they are to make and subsequently publish. They shouldn’t be underestimated but are they the best way to get started? Yes and no. If you have an existing audience, publishing a few .gifs everyday will keep them coming back for more. If you don’t have that luxury, consistently publishing on multiple avenues, like open sourcing (on GitHub) publishing a Devlog (on Tigsource) or making videos (for YouTube) gives you a lot sticks in the fire. Combine that with publishing .gifs and you practically have it made!

Provided you deliver new free content as often as possible, this is all it takes to gain an audience.

Use popular tools or games as your library for new content. For example, think about the big gaming YouTubers. Sure, they all have their personalities that can drive views, but you are only going to watch the video if you are interested in what they are doing or in our case, playing.

Which leads us to the best part... Creator's love when you use their tools and play their games! It’s free marketing for them, so the more you post about them, the more they want you to succeed! Not only are you using their product to help build your audience, but you may even get them to broadcast to their audience about your content! That is one positive reinforcement loop you definitely want a piece of!

But hey! Even offering opinions on something gives you a unique stand and that will always be content worth coming back for.

This can be a great strategy to jumpstart your professional career into game design. You will get noticed and down the line when you make your own game, you will have people already following you who are eager to see what you make! 

## Seeking Opportunities

While being passionate is what got you to walk in the door, it’s not going to be enough to keep you interested in the long haul. This is the moment where most are blinded by what passion really has to offer, because it can achieve temporary gratification. To sustain this you must keep seeking new opportunities. 

Focus on getting good at something related to your passion. Maybe Game Development is too technical, take a look at the marketing side of things. Maybe you are really good at Web Development, make a website showcasing a game! As you can see Game Design can have a lot of moving parts. You won’t be number one at everything and in this case, you don’t need to be. Knowing when to take a step back from your project, and leverage your best skills, is your biggest observational advantage to be on the lookout for new opportunities.

I started with Animation but quickly realized I couldn’t draw. Instead I focused on using ready-made characters and making them move! This gave me a completely different opportunity that still fell under the Animation umbrella and enabled me to work as an 2D Animator.

Let’s take a look at game development. I have made dozens and dozens of games, clones and engines but quickly found what I love about it.  I love to learn new languages, frameworks and engines and I am good at it. With this logic, it’s natural for my opportunity within game creation was to teach. 

Identify what opportunities lie within the thing you are most passionate about and make it into a project. Learning a new skill, when it’s directly paying you back (by being relevant to your passion) is how you can sustain your career in the long haul. I guarantee you will find this to be a refreshing (and happy) experience in doing so.

E-mail me what opportunities lie within your passion and what projects you can make out of it.

## In-Between Learning 
I’m sure at some point in your life, someone has said to you “Keep Learning”. While this advice can work, there is something to be said for what I call, “In-between Learning”. In-between learning, is just a fancy way to say, learn as you go. 

Learning as you go has been around for years and is a technique that has been more recently used with creating a “minimum viable product”. Instead of learning all at once to make a month long project (like you do in school) we can use in-between learning to make 4 little projects each week. By the fourth project you will see quicker results than you would if making one big project. In addition, you won’t be nearly as burnt out and in fact, each time you finish a project you’ve climbed another rung on the experience ladder!

The experience ladder is something you will continue to climb throughout your career and every time you do, you get more natural motivation to get better at what it is you’re doing.

In-between learning forces you to act. And within this act you give yourself a limited amount of time to get something done. This is what promotes growth (and project completion) whereas traditional learning can deplete your energy by the time a project is due. In some cases, this can lead you to never pursue that passion ever again because of how much time it takes away from just getting the end result!

## Utilizing Passion

Hopefully by this point I have alerted you to always be on the lookout for opportunities within your passion, but this shouldn’t be used as an escape. 

Instead it’s more like this. Martin Garrix, a world-renowned DJ and Music Producer is only 20 years old and has more than a few hit songs under his belt. His success shouldn't surprise you, instead you should realize what he did. That passion that got him to walk in the door manifested itself into the form of software known as FL Studio. 

Before we get back to what opportunity his passion brought to the table, let’s talk about FL Studio. I know very little about music making software but I do have friends who produce music and at first glance it’s quite an intimidating program. This might be a feeling you know all too well (as most game engines can definitely cause such stress) but this is where you shouldn’t hesitate. When you see intimidating software related to your passion, don’t ever write it off. Invest your time into it. It’s going to be difficult the first few hundred tries but, just like with in-between learning, the more you produce with the software (no matter the quality) the better you become.

Martin is my first example because he started making music professionally in 2012 but spent all of his time using FL Studio since 2004.

You caught that right? He had been using FL Studio for eight years day in and day out before he turned pro. In total, Martin has used FL Studio for more than half his life.

Today software is changing rapidly with programs that claim they do “X Better Than Anyone Else”, but the truth is they can all do X, it’s how much you know the software that can do “X Better Than Anyone Else”. Now Martin is ahead because he has years into the software so don’t let that get you down, let that tell you if this is the right program, the right career for you! If you can see yourself using this software for the next 5 years, commit yourself to mastering it as you make projects with it. 

To find the software that is right for you is unfortunately something I can’t help with. I can only show you what each software does and give my opinion on what I like/dislike about them. 

I can however give you my rules of thumb to make sure the program is here to stay.

Find out who creates the software (Whether individual, Small Team or Big Company) and look at their blog. Find out when their most recent post was as a post from last year isn’t a good sign of being an active creator. 
Look at their version control for their recent pushes. If this is applicable and the software is posted on sites like GitHub, then check to see when the last commit was. If it says “1 year ago” signs are it’s no longer active. This doesn’t mean you can’t still use the software, it’s just not the software you want to invest in for the long term.
Check the creators Social Media. Check Twitter for recent tweets, see if the software itself has it’s Facebook page or group. 
Find the groups of people on Facebook or otherwise who are using the software and look at what their experience is like. Check to see when they last hashtagged their Tweets with the software’s name.

Most software that has an audience greater than a few thousand users will likely be around for a long time. Luckily for Martin, FL Studio has been around since 1997, so even in 2004 when he discovered it, it already had a mature audience. 
To finish up with Martin, let’s look at the opportunities that arose out mastering this software. FL Studio uses plug-ins to 

-Making Plugins
-DJing Venues
-Starting his own Label
-Work with other successful artists


Ironically also Dutch let’s talk about Jan Willem Nijman who is 50% of the Game Development studio, Vlambeer and his title should say it all. What draws me to use Jan Willem as an example is the same thing that draws me to Martin. They both have put years into their respective software since it’s early versions. We will go into more detail about Game Maker Studio (Jan Willem’s choice of software) soon but for now, let’s understand Jan Willem’s approach. 

Jan Willem went to school for Game Development but quickly realized that he could spend all of his time making games. After learning (and mastering) the software he chose, he let’s his passion lead him to the next project. This has created multiple opportunities

-Starting a Company (Vlambeer)
-Key Speaking for Events
-Collaborating with other designers

From an outside view, without knowing about what both Martin and Jan Willem have been through to get to where they are, I can confidently say they wouldn’t be there if their passion didn’t lead them. They are constantly focusing on their end products and how with the skills they have acquired with their software can make the end a reality. 

By the end of this chapter, hopefully you have a clear idea on where your passion can lead you. After all of this talk about how you need to find the software you commit too, let’s talk about why you can always change at a moment's notice.

Most software today overlap with features and can even have similar UI experiences. While I recommend you learn and master one program at a time, you can apply in-between learning to switch. For me, when I first started using engines to make games, I used Multimedia Fusion 2 and learned everything I could about it. Then a few months later Construct Classic came out and it had me more intrigued. I took the similar knowledge I had learned with MMF2 and applied it C2 pretty seamlessly. Today, software like Unity and Unreal have the same kind of parallels. Whereas Construct 2 and Game Maker Studio can be used almost interchangeably when you know what you are doing.

Mastering one piece of software can also give you the opportunity to switch to different software at a later point in time.

## What It Means to Make A Game
What does it really mean to make a video game? From my own experience it means whatever I imagine, I can create. It’s one of the very pure forms of expression because anything can happen. One minute you can be fighting a couple monsters that are easy, and in a split second an alien could come abduct you. Some games are designed to be random, in fact the more random they are, the less sense they make and therefore the more rage inducing they can be.

A great example of this is a game called I Wanna Be The Guy. It used sprites from around the internet and no matter where you moved you weren’t safe. The whole mechanics were walk, jump, double jump and shoot. One second you are running from wall spikes, the next you have Mike Tyson trying to punch you out! It really is the most random game, yet that was it’s whole purpose. 

When we utilize our passion and combine it with in-between learning, there is a chance you are sacrificing quality over quantity. I don’t think that’s true. I think we have a skewed version of what makes something of “quality” in our culture today. Not everything has to have hours of work poured into it before it can become something amazing.

Minecraft was made in a week. By sharing Minecraft with the world, the game took on a whole new meaning. It was as if everyone was developing it, especially when they introduced mods. 

But ask yourself. Why are you making this game? And you will find the meaning behind it. Here are some reasons that could be why:

You want to tell a story you made
You want to create your own world
You want to make a game to be the next big success

Whatever the reason is, make sure you know why. When you do, the rest of the game becomes easier to finish. For example, we started to develop a game all about a Sock Puppet. Originally, I just wanted to make a level of a Sock Puppet going on a rampage, but it felt like it was missing something.

Even though we didn’t need a story, we made one anyway. We gave the character meaning and an environment for it to grow in and the second we did, the pieces fell into place. Giving your character a purpose, or your enemies silly backgrounds, is a great way to add quality faster and not sacrifice anything for it.

Not to mention, you will learn exactly what your game means to you.

## Which Engine Should You Use

Before we look at where we go with all of this information, let’s take a look at the popular game engines out there you might want to use. Hopefully this chapter will give you a clearer idea which engine is for you. I have left out programming languages as we would be here for days.

### Construct 2
Let’s start with my engine of choice. Construct 2 is a simple to use, drag and drop game editor that let’s you make HTML5 games with ease. If you have never made a game before then this is a great starting point. To further explain, Construct 2 let’s you make any 2D game without any typing of code, and it actually works. Most engines that claim “no programming required” has some kind of language attached to it for their “advanced users”. For me, Construct 2’s visual flow is structured in a way that to me, makes sense. In addition, when using Construct 2, I always feel challenged to write better logic because of how it’s code blocks work.

Construct 2 is not for everyone (so just because it’s my go to doesn’t mean it should be yours). Most programmers don’t need visual programming and for some, it slows them down instead of speeding them up. But regardless of what level you are at, Construct 2 displays logic (even the more advanced objects) in an extremely user friendly way.

If you are looking for a simple way to get your ideas realized, Construct 2 is the perfect editor for you. If you want software that can do it all, I would look elsewhere. You will however save yourself the stress of learning a language while still learning how languages work. Within a few hours of using the software you will already feel like you are on your way to mastering it. Plus, Construct 3 will come out eventually...

### Game Maker Studio
For making full 2D Games there is no doubt that Game Maker Studio can handle it. With a major release of the software coming out soon (as of writing this) Game Maker is here to stay and from the looks of it, will only get better with producing amazing games.

### Game Maker Studio 2

If you are looking to heavily invest in 2D game design, this is your place to do it. Not only does it support drag and drop, but it has it’s own language that is extremely beginner friendly and not to mention useful. GML (Game Maker Language) comes with predefined methods that make the coding process even easier and it shows. It’s rumored that we will have some additional language support in the new version known as GMS2, but we will have to wait and see when it comes out! 

If making 2D games is your life and you are in it for the long haul, I would take the time to learn the ins and outs of Game Maker. Not only is it mature software (c. 1999), but the community is incredible and the from the looks of things, it’s only just getting started!

### Unity3D

Most beginners scream when they see what Unity3D looks like but it’s not as bad as they think. Unity3D is a 3D engine that has 2D capabilities. With it’s massively growing user base it’s a force to be reckoned with. With VR on the rise, Unity will become a huge contender for the next decade. 

If you are looking for software that can really, do it all, you absolutely cannot go wrong with Unity. For the most part, expect to learn C# but even that is a breeze with Unity’s editor. Unity helped pioneer a newly adopted pricing structure for this kind of software. The free version can do it all, until you hit X amount of money. It’s this structure that give them a humongous out of the gate advantage when it had to compete with engines like Unreal and Cry. 

Some view this is as an advantage, others may not. As we know, Unity has a massive community behind it, but that means plugins, and lot’s of them. The Unity asset store is one of the most popular Game Dev stores there is and it shows. There are graphics, tools, frameworks and even Visual Scripters. Some of the Visual Scripting plugins are amazing but super costly and this could be a huge downside to using Unity as most plugins will set you back!

### Unreal

Unreal is to Unity3D what Game Maker Studio is to Construct 2. It’s mature software that can handle everything thrown at it, and it does it well. It specializes in 3D and more recently VR for Oculus Rift but of course it can also handle 2D. Unreal has a unique visual scripting editor built in known as Blueprints that gives non-programmers an extremely easy way to make a 3D game.

Until Unity came along, Unreal was always pricey, now it’s free! You can enjoy everything about Unreal and like Game Maker, it’s worth your investment in the long haul.  

### Godot

This engine has taken me by surprise, so it’s only right I mention it. It works on all major OS, entirely open source and handles 2D/3D in a similar way that Unity does. It truly could be the next biggest thing. Best part, it’s FREE!

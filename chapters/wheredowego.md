# Where do we go?

## Using Your Foundation
We’ve heard about our new mindset, defined our scope and have laid out the processes for our new ways of thinking and learning. So how do we use it? 

It’s time to grab a notebook or your favorite note taking app (I switch between Google Docs and Evernote) and write down what your day consists of. I’ve spoken to many game developers (some of which you will hear from in the interviews) and everyone’s day is different. Some have part-time jobs on-top of full-time jobs, and still manage to make time for their game. Some have children to take care of, plus extra responsibilities that not everyone can relate to. 

Once you write down your day, you’ve started to build your foundation. This foundation cannot be a house of cards. If you don’t have a consistent routine each day don’t sweat it. At this stage you need to be honest about that. Going forward, everything comes into reality. Hitting the foundation stage means this is actually happening, so if something feels off, then maybe Game Design isn’t the right area for you. You could say this for any field of course, but by following every chapter in this book, I want to stop you here.

If you have felt a shift in your thought process from these tips then keep going. If you have started to get more ideas for games as you read, then you’re about to find out how to make them actionable. If you feel nothing and are still lost, I would like to encourage to re-read or finish the book in it’s entirety but that’s how learning works. You are here, reading a book on a subject that you have had an interest in and are finding out if you can/should pursue it.

## Crafting your Schedule
Work in X hour bursts. If you don’t have a schedule then tell yourself that you will sit down for X hours each day to work on your game. I find that one hour is too short and three hours is too long, so find a middle ground. For me, I work in two hour bursts and then I break for an hour. Two hours gets me thinking and helps me to not burn out. 

Now that you have hopefully come to terms with your foundation and are starting to work on your game in time bursts, it’s time to set the first deadline. No one ever likes to hear the word deadline because it can cause extreme amounts of pressure and stress but as a game developer (someone who usually works independently) these are a must.

To make deadlines less painful we need to do what we’ve done this entire time. We need to find our first few core essentials and work from there. Since we already know how to find the essentials, how do we hold ourselves accountable? 

Following our logic of “two at a time”, set out two tasks to get finished each day. Of course you can do more but let’s keep this simple. By finishing two tasks each day (following a normal 5 day workweek) we get 10 tasks accomplished. That number may be low now, but when you put in the work, those 10 tasks are going to feel incredible. 

That feeling is what will motivate you to reach your deadline. Give yourself two weeks. Usually, I like to give myself two weeks for a project or a larger task. If it goes past that, stop working and go back to our chapter on “Defining the Scope”. Every two weeks you will have 20 tasks done. Let’s take a look at mine when I was working on my Run N Gun.

Monday
Set-up layout structure for Pixelated Game
Create Player controls for Keyboard and Gamepad
Tuesday
Hire an artist to draw the assets needed
Design our placeholder level
Wednesday
Program player Fall and Wall Slide
Start Enemy AI Type 1 (Flying Bat)
Thursday
Finish Enemy AI Type 1
Start Enemy AI Type 2 (Running Zombie)
Friday
Finish Enemy AI Type 2
Start Enemy AI Type 3 (Hopping Spider)
Monday
Finish Enemy AI Type 3
Implement artists graphics
Tuesday
Start Programming Projectile System
Continue work on Projectile System (Add knockback, sound effects, screenshake, shells)
Wednesday
Add multiple weapons with projectile system in place
Start adding in game loop (Kill counter, timer)
Thursday
Create our HUD (Health)
Add SFX and Extra Game Effects
Friday
Create a Menu
Export Game

Some will say that after two weeks, if your project isn’t complete you should move on. For longer projects, or even freelance work, you may not be able to work within such parameters. Regardless of the schedule you have, take the two at a time process to start and finish your tasks. Again you will find that each time you cross one off you are more pumped to start and finish the next.

## Handling Delays
Delays could be inevitable if you discover something that doesn’t work along the way. To combat this, spend some time to find a solution but remind yourself the solution shouldn’t stop progress. From our list in the last chapter, you will notice that on the first Tuesday I had to reach out to an artist and order assets for my game. While I knew this process would take longer than I wanted it to, I wasn’t going to let it get in the way of working towards completion. In fact, it was almost a week later until all of the assets were done. While artwork is essential for your finished game, you can still set things aside and revisit them later, no matter how essential it is.

For some, this could be a dealbreaker. The linear thinking is to do everything one after the other but designing and developing can work asynchronously! 

When a problem presents itself, find the solution. If you can’t find it immediately, work on the next task. If you do find it and it can be implemented immediately then do so. If it takes a couple hours then revisit it later.
